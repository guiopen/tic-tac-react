# tic-tac-react
This is a small tic tac toe game i made to learn react native. My process was to create a normal react app following taking inspiration from the react quick start tutorial ( https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe ) and then port it to react native. It was a good learning experience and taught me the differences between react native and normal react.
